shootingstar-arduino

This basically plays the famous 00s song Shooting Star lead melody by Bag Raiders on arduino. 
Aside from an arduino you will need a passive buzzer to play the song, but usually you 
will get one when you buy the arduino itself. 
The buzzer needs to be connected to the 8th pin and also to the ground.

·	It's uncompleted since the track is not fully imlemented yet. (skips interlude)
·	The final idea consists in make an arduino full band that plays all of the song's tracks. (Maybe using I2C for synchro)
·	Also, the code is really wanky, it needs refactoring.
